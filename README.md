# PMD Planner Backend

This is the backend for my site hosted at [pmdplanner.com.](https://www.pmdplanner.com)
The frontend repository for the application can be found [here.](https://github.com/bubbledrift/PMD-Planner)

It's main responsibility currently is to keep track
of pokemon popularity and relay that to the frontend.
This backend is written in Java and uses the Java Spark web
framework. It keeps track of data in a sqlite3 database and
is deployed through Heroku.
